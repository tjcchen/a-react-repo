/**
 * React Profiler
 * - The Profiler measures how often a React application renders and what the "cost" of rendering is.
 *   Its purpose is to help identify parts of an application that are slow and may benefit from optimiztions
 *   such as memoization.
 * - You'll need the React DevTools extension (Chrome) to use the "DevTools profiler plugin"
 * - Works perfect together with @welldone-software/why-did-you-render library
