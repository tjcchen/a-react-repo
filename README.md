## a-react-repo
A reactjs app repository

## Website vs Web app
1. Website( presenting products / services )
- blogs
- portfolio's
- landing pages

2. Web app( Software running in a browser )
- social media platforms
- dashboards
- editing programs
- banking applications

## SPA( Single Page Application )
- Dynamic updates of the current web page( with data from a server ) instead of loading entire new pages
- Faster transitions => feels more like a native app

Non-SPA
- TripAdvisor( https://www.tripadvisor.com )
- Slow / clunky
SPA
- React Dashboard( https://react-material.fusetheme.com/dashboards/project )
- Fast / native-like

## Components
- Reusable
- Maintainable( refactoring, bug fixes, testing )

## React = Declarative
Declarative vs Imperative
- Telling what to do instead of how to do it

Declarative
- I want dinner with broccoli
React: here's your broccoli

Imperative
- Go to the kitchen
- Open fridge
- Remove broccoli from fridge
- Serve broccoli

## To start with
