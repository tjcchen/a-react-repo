A reactjs app repository

## Website vs Web app
1. Website( presenting products / services )
- blogs
- portfolio's
- landing pages

2. Web app( Software running in a browser )
- social media platforms
- dashboards
- editing programs
- banking applications

## SPA( Single Page Application )
- Dynamic updates of the current web page( with data from a server ) instead of loading entire new pages
- Faster transitions => feels more like a native app

Non-SPA
- TripAdvisor( https://www.tripadvisor.com )
- Slow / clunky
SPA
- React Dashboard( https://react-material.fusetheme.com/dashboards/project )
- Fast / native-like
