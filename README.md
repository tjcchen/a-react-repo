## Website vs Web app
1. Website( presenting products / services )
- blogs
- portfolio's
- landing pages

2. Web app( Software running in a browser )
- social media platforms
- dashboards

## SPA( Single Page Application )
- Dynamic updates of the current web page( with data from a server ) instead of loading entire new pages
- Faster transitions => feels more like a native app
